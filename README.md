# Minecraft Legends Documentation
This repository houses the documentation for Minecraft Legends. It will help you understand how the data is laid out and how to make your own mods for the game.

Watch this space as we're planning on releasing more documentation in the future. For now, you can check out the entry below which describes all of the behaviours available to entities in the game.

## Entities
From Piglins invading the overworld to allays gathering resources, all of the Minecraft Legends gameplay comes from entities. You can think of them as things that have behaviour and may or may not have a visual representation. They are defined in JSON files and split across Behaviour packs and Resource packs.

More documentation can be found on the [entities page](Entities.md).
