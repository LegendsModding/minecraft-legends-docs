## Introduction

The Minecraft Legends Documentation is an open-source project aimed at providing a comprehensive, **Community Creator** resource for the game. Whether you're fixing typos, adding new content, or suggesting new ideas, we welcome contributions from the community.

## Reporting Issues or Asking Questions

If you encounter bugs, issues, or if you have questions about anything related to Minecraft Legends or modding it, feel free to submit an issue through our [GitHub Issues Page](https://github.com/LegendsModding/minecraft-legends-docs/issues).

Be sure to:

- **Clearly describe** the problem or question.
- If applicable, include **steps to reproduce** the issue.
- Provide **screenshots or logs** to help us understand and resolve the issue faster, if applicable.

**_Legends Modding Note_**: We will be taking our general(not LCU) Minecraft Legends bug reports here for now, given the bug tracker being closed. While we can't guarantee we can fix anything, it's good to see what main issues are still happening and see what can be addressed.

## Contributing Documentation

Weâ€™re grateful for any help with improving our documentation, tools, and samples! Follow these steps to contribute:

### Setting Up Your Legendary Documentation Environment

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button on the GitHub page to create your own copy of the repo.
2. **Clone the Repo Locally**: Use the following command to clone your forked repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/minecraft-legends-docs.git
   ```

3. **Create a New Branch**: Before making any changes, create a new branch for your work:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b docs/new-new-doc
   ```

## Submitting a Mythical Pull Request

1. Once your changes are complete, **commit** them to your local branch:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new doc"
   ```

2. Push your changes to your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin docs/new-doc
   ```

3. Open a **Pull Request** on GitHub. In the PR description, explain:
   - What changes were made.
   - Why the changes are important.
   - Any discussions or issues related to the PR.

## Writing and Updating Documentation

Contributions to documentation are just as important as code contributions. Hereâ€™s how you can help:

1. **Create a new Markdown file** in the appropriate folder for new documentation or update an existing file.
    - _Note_: We are yet to re-organize things fully still, you are welcome to help!
2. Write **clear and concise** instructions and explanations. Ensure that it is beginner-friendly and follows the style guidelines below.
3. Add thorough and self-describing **examples** whenever possible to help clarify complex concepts.
4. If contributing new features, describe their **purpose, usage, and best practices**.
5. Before submitting your pull request, thoroughly **test your changes**.

## Documentation Style

To maintain consistency and readability across our documentation, please follow these guidelines when contributing:

- Use **Markdown formatting** consistently (headings, lists, links, code blocks, etc.).
- Ensure proper use of headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) to structure content hierarchically.
- Write clear and concise descriptions with bullet points or numbered lists where appropriate.
- Use proper line breaks and indentation for readability.
- Test any code snippets or instructions before including them in the documentation.
- Keep commit messages short, descriptive, and relevant.
- **_PLEASE_** try to avoid all inline html.
